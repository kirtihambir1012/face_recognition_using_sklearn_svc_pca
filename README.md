Hi, this is the project "Face recognition using sklearn svc pca", I have made under the guidance of "Astha Sinha" Madam.

# Facial Recognition with Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project demonstrates facial recognition using machine learning techniques. It leverages the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset to train a model capable of identifying individuals from their facial features. The project employs Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for efficient classification and dimensionality reduction.

## Key Features

* **Face Detection and Recognition:** Identifies and recognizes faces within images.
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality while preserving essential facial features.
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Performs classification based on learned features.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes model performance using GridSearchCV.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Assesses accuracy, precision, and visualizes results with a confusion matrix and classification reports.

## Libraries Used

* scikit-learn (sklearn)
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, a publicly available collection of face photographs designed for studying unconstrained face recognition.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook facial_recognition_using_sklearn.ipynb`

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 0.85 and a precision of 0.86 on the test set. The confusion matrix and classification report provide further insights into the model's performance.

## Potential Applications

This project can be applied to various fields, including:

* **Security Systems:** Enhancing security measures through facial recognition-based access control.
* **Image Tagging:** Automating the tagging of individuals in photographs.
* **User Authentication:** Providing secure authentication methods using facial recognition.
